Python Loops
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.

Python has two primitive loop commands:

while loops
for loops

While Loop
The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true


Syntax:
while expression:
   Body of while
# Program to print numbers in ascending order till the mentioned limit
i = 1
while i <= 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1

print("Execution Completed!")

Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
Execution Completed!

Using else Statement with Loops
If the else statement is used with a while loop, the else statement is executed when the condition becomes false.


 
# Program to print numbers in ascending order till the mentioned limit 
i = 1
while i <= 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print("Else statement is executed at the end as mandatory")

print("Execution Completed!")

Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
Else statement is executed at the end as mandatory
Execution Completed!
Infinite Loop
A loop becomes infinite loop if a 
condition never becomes FALSE. This results in a loop that never ends. Such a loop is called an infinite loop
Use CTRL+C to exit the program
