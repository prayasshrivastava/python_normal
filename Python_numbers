Python Numbers
Python support 3 different numerical types :
1. Integer
2. Float
3. Complex Number

i = 50 # Number without decimal point - Integer
f = 3.14 # Number with decimal point - Float
x = 2 + 3j # Number consists of both real and imaginary value - Complex Number
print(i,f,x)

Output:
50 3.14 (2+3j)
Identifying the Variable Types
type()- inbuilt function which is used to determine the type of the variable.


 
print(type(i))
print(type(f))
print(type(x))

Output:
class 'int'
class 'float'
class 'complex'
